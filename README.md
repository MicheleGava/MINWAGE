## **Overview**

Effectiveness and opportunity of a law-established miminum wage is an opened debate
Actually, there some pros and cons arguments on which researchers, politicians and social parts discuss, being unable to meet on some agreements:
Pros:
- minimum wage is mean to gain social equity
- can improve overall life quality on lower social classes
- lead to a fairier labour market, giving more power to weaker counterparts
- fix distortions of the "gig economy", enhancing employers with farier hiring policies 

Cons:
- raises labour cost, leading to raising unemplyoment
- for the same reason, leads to higher inflation 
- promotes undeclare work
- disincentives foreign investments

## **Objectives**

Objective of the present work is to provide some insights based on available data to address some of the questions heades in the *Overview* section. For the scope of this analysis, we concentrate on data relative to the **European Union**
In particular, we want to investigate:

1. How is minumum wage distributed in the EU? Which countries have a minimum wage and what's the proportion to the overall wage level? How is it changing over time?
2. Is there any association between presence/absence of minimum wage and other labour market (unemployment rate) and economic indicators (GDP)?
3. In the coutries where minumum wage is present, can we find any association between minimum wage level and other indicators?
